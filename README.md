🌌 Astronomy Tracker

This is a simple yet immersive astronomy tracker web app I built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.  
The design is inspired by the beauty of the night sky featuring glassmorphism effects, smooth transitions, and a calm starfield background that gives you that peaceful "stargazing" feeling.
