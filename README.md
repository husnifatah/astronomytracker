🌌 Astronomy Tracker

This is a simple yet immersive astronomy tracker web app I built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.  
The design is inspired by the beauty of the night sky featuring glassmorphism effects, smooth transitions, and a calm starfield background that gives you that peaceful "stargazing" feeling.


✨ Features

- 🌙 Real-time moon phase calendar
- 🪐 Solar system planet data from an open API  
- 🌠 Astronomy fact of the day, updated daily  
- 🌗 Automatic dark mode based on your local time, with manual toggle  
- 📱 Fully responsive UI with a relaxing cosmic theme
