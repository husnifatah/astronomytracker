  {
    title: "The Sun's Energy",
    fact: "The Sun produces more energy in one second than humanity has used in its entire history. It converts about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second."
  },
  {
    title: "Venus's Rotation",
    fact: "Venus rotates backwards compared to most planets and rotates so slowly that a day on Venus (243 Earth days) is longer than its year (225 Earth days)."
  },
  {
    title: "Neutron Star Density",
    fact: "A neutron star is so dense that a teaspoon of neutron star material would weigh about 6 billion tons - equivalent to the mass of Mount Everest."
  },
  {
    title: "Jupiter's Great Red Spot",
    fact: "Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has been raging for over 400 years. Wind speeds reach up to 400 mph."
  },
  {
    title: "Saturn's Density",
    fact: "Saturn is less dense than water. If you could find an ocean large enough, Saturn would float in it."
  },
  {
    title: "Light Speed",
    fact: "Light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth, traveling at 186,282 miles per second."
  },
  {
    title: "Milky Way Galaxy",
    fact: "Our galaxy, the Milky Way, contains an estimated 100-400 billion stars and is about 100,000 light-years across."
  },
  {
    title: "Moon's Distance",
    fact: "The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) per year, roughly the same rate at which fingernails grow."
  },
  {
    title: "Mars's Seasons",
    fact: "Mars has seasons similar to Earth because its axial tilt is 25 degrees (Earth's is 23.5 degrees), but each season lasts about twice as long."
  },
  {
    title: "Space Silence",
    fact: "Space is completely silent because there are no air molecules to carry sound waves. In space, no one can hear you scream!"
  },
  {
    title: "Olympus Mons",
    fact: "The largest volcano in our solar system is Olympus Mons on Mars, standing 13.6 miles (22 km) high - nearly three times taller than Mount Everest."
  },
  {
    title: "One Year on Neptune",
    fact: "Neptune takes 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. It only completed its first full orbit since its discovery in 2011."
